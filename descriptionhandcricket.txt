                                Everyone likes to play and watch cricket.Now here is the code for playing hand cricket.
                        Initially two players as player 1 and player 2 start the game.The toss decides which player have to 
                        bat and bowl.Until a player Won the toss Follow the Output and give whatever it asks you to give.
                        Then the Player who won the toss chooses either to Bat or to Bowl.The Player who chose batting 
                        and bowling has to proceed enter ky one by one,Where System will generate Random number as 
                        runs for both players.Player 1 runs keeps on adding until his runs equals to player 2 runs.Finally
                        When Player 1 is Out.Till then his runs are his final Score.The Same process will be Conducted for 
                        player.Finally whoever is having Highest Score is the Winner.

                              *  #include<time.h> - used to maipulate date and time.
                    
                     Special functions used :
                               
                              *  srand()

                              *  Use of srand() :
                   
                                            For Example: Player 1 Won the Toss And Chose Batting.Then When Player 1 Press Enter Key,
                    a score will be generated for Player 1. Suppose runs are 5 So Player 1 Score=5.Then Player 2 Also Presses Enter 
                    key.Then if he got a Score of 4.So Player 2 Score =4.As Player 1 Score is not equal to player 2 Score,then Player
                   1 is not out and his score will be 5 after 1st ball.In 2nd ball Player 1 got 3 runs and Player 2 got 4.Since again both are
                   not equal.Player 1 Score=5+3=8.If in the 3rd Ball Player 1 got 4 runs and Player 2 also got 4 runs Then Player 1 
                   Score is equal to Player 2's Score Then Player 1 is Out. Then Final Score of player 1 is 8 runs.The Same Process is
                  done for Player 2.So Finaly who ever got more score is Winner.
